    ## Overview
    
    Plant phenology – the timing of plant life-cycle events such as leafing out, flowering, 
    and fruiting – plays a fundamental role in the functioning of natural ecosystems and 
    human agricultural and economic systems. Plant phenology is sensitive to environmental 
    change and changes in plant phenology can dramatically impact ecosystem function and 
    services. Therefore, plant phenology is at the center of understanding how accelerating 
    environmental changes (e.g., climate and land-use changes) are reshaping biosphere. 
    However, urgent phenology-related scientific questions remain difficult to answer due
    to both a lack of sufficient data and substantial challenges with integrating those data 
    that have been collected. To address this challenge, we will build upon our substantial 
    preliminary work over the last several years to 1) develop a global, standardized knowledge
    base (Phenobase) of phenological data by integrating different phenology observation networks 
    around the world; 2) expand this knowledge base by using computer vision (CV) techniques 
    to generate new, high-quality phenological data from the rapidly growing collection of
    community-submitted plant photographs on iNaturalist and Budburst; 3) add critical historical
    phenological data to the knowledge base by using similar CV techniques on herbarium specimens
    available through iDigBio and GBIF; 4) develop tools for data query, access, and visualization
    delivered via the Web and as software packages; and 5) foster compelling, community-driven use
    cases showcasing the use of Phenobase for new research and for public good. In short, Phenobase
    will support community needs for generating and delivering high-precision, harmonized and
    semantically integrated plant phenological data at unprecedented taxonomic, geographic, 
    and temporal scales, along with new tools to help scientists and the public engage with these data.
    
    ## Intellectual merit
    
    Creating an accessible, integrated knowledge base of global plant phenological data 
    with broad taxonomic, spatial, and temporal coverage (and tools to aid data use) will 
    have far-reaching basic and applied scientific impact. Phenobase has two major 
    intellectual merits. First, by closing taxonomic, spatial and temporal knowledge-gaps, 
    it will enable finer-grain and broader extent analyses, dramatically improving 
    understanding of global plant phenology pattern and process, relation to ecosystem function,
    and responses to climate and landscape change. This will, in turn, provide the basis for 
    better predictive models that can be used for responding to the conservation, agricultural,
    and economic consequences of phenology change. A second area of merit is use of new tools 
    to automate assembly and integration of vast and growing phenological data sources. At the
    core of this proposed work is a well-tested ontology- based data integration system that 
    supports machine reasoning to dramatically enhance discovery of research-ready phenology 
    data. This core is strongly augmented by links to cutting edge computer vision approaches 
    that provide a means to keep pace with the exponential increases in plant photographs and 
    borne-digital specimen vouchers and integrate them with in situ human observation data.
    
    ## Broader impacts
    
    Plant phenology data and related products are well suited for outreach initiatives given 
    their obvious and intuitive connections to a variety of topics of general interest, such 
    as food supply and agriculture, gardening, conservation, and climate change. Phenobase 
    leverages the innate societal interest in phenology in developing three major community,
    educational and public outreach components. First, we will host annual hybrid working 
    groups built around Phenobase to catalyze community involvement and new collaborations 
    within the phenology research community. Second, we will provide hands-on, multidisciplinary
    training connecting the science of phenology with software development for undergraduate 
    and graduate researchers who will be directly involved in the development and testing 
    of our data access software packages. We will develop curriculum to improve the data 
    science literacy of undergraduate biology students through the exploration of computer 
    vision approaches and phenology data via a new data carpentry module. Finally, we will 
    work with citizen science projects such as Notes from Nature, iNaturalist, and Budburst 
    to empower people around the world to contribute to phenology research.
