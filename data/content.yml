    ## Overview
    
    Plant phenology – the timing of plant life-cycle events such as leafing out, flowering, 
    and fruiting – plays a fundamental role in the functioning of natural ecosystems and 
    human agricultural and economic systems. Plant phenology is sensitive to environmental 
    change and changes in plant phenology can dramatically impact ecosystem function and 
    services. Therefore, plant phenology is at the center of understanding how accelerating 
    environmental changes (e.g., climate and land-use changes) are reshaping biosphere. 
    However, urgent phenology-related scientific questions remain difficult to answer due
    to both a lack of sufficient data and substantial challenges with integrating those data 
    that have been collected. To address this challenge, we will build upon our substantial 
    preliminary work over the last several years to 1) develop a global, standardized knowledge
    base (Phenobase) of phenological data by integrating different phenology observation networks 
    around the world; 2) expand this knowledge base by using computer vision (CV) techniques 
    to generate new, high-quality phenological data from the rapidly growing collection of
    community-submitted plant photographs on iNaturalist and Budburst; 3) add critical historical
    phenological data to the knowledge base by using similar CV techniques on herbarium specimens
    available through iDigBio and GBIF; 4) develop tools for data query, access, and visualization
    delivered via the Web and as software packages; and 5) foster compelling, community-driven use
    cases showcasing the use of Phenobase for new research and for public good. In short, Phenobase
    will support community needs for generating and delivering high-precision, harmonized and
    semantically integrated plant phenological data at unprecedented taxonomic, geographic, 
    and temporal scales, along with new tools to help scientists and the public engage with these data.
    
    ## Intellectual merit
    
    Creating an accessible, integrated knowledge base of global plant phenological data with broad taxonomic, spatial, and temporal coverage (and tools to aid data use) will have far-reaching basic and applied scientific impact. Phenobase has two major intellectual merits. First, by closing taxonomic, spatial and temporal knowledge-gaps, it will enable finer-grain and broader extent analyses, dramatically improving understanding of global plant phenology pattern and process, relation to ecosystem function, and responses to climate and landscape change. This will, in turn, provide the basis for better predictive models that can be used for responding to the conservation, agricultural, and economic consequences of phenology change. A second area of merit is use of new tools to automate assembly and integration of vast and growing phenological data sources. At the core of this proposed work is a well-tested ontology- based data integration system that supports machine reasoning to dramatically enhance discovery of research-ready phenology data. This core is strongly augmented by links to cutting edge computer vision approaches that provide a means to keep pace with the exponential increases in plant photographs and borne-digital specimen vouchers and integrate them with in situ human observation data.
    
    ## Broader impacts
    
    Plant phenology data and related products are well suited for outreach initiatives given their obvious and intuitive connections to a variety of topics of general interest, such as food supply and agriculture, gardening, conservation, and climate change. Phenobase leverages the innate societal interest in phenology in developing three major community, educational and public outreach components. First, we will host annual hybrid working groups built around Phenobase to catalyze community involvement and new collaborations within the phenology research community. Second, we will provide hands-on, multidisciplinary training connecting the science of phenology with software development for undergraduate and graduate researchers who will be directly involved in the development and testing of our data access software packages. We will develop curriculum to improve the data science literacy of undergraduate biology students through the exploration of computer vision approaches and phenology data via a new data carpentry module. Finally, we will work with citizen science projects such as Notes from Nature, iNaturalist, and Budburst to empower people around the world to contribute to phenology research.

        Rob Guralnick is a UF Research Foundation Professor and Curator of Biodiversity Informatics at the University of Florida and Florida Museum of Natural History.  His work focuses on understanding global environmental change, and he uses community science approaches along with machine learning to generate and assemble data and models about specie distributions and traits.  These approaches are all in service to better understand which species might win or lose in the face of global change. He has special interest in phenology and phenologica responses to changing environments.

        Ellen Denny is the Monitoring Design & Data Coordinator for the USA National Network (USA-NPN), which is based at the University of Arizona in Tucson. She has coordinated the development of the USA-NPN protocols for the collection of standardized ground-based plant and animal phenology observations across the nation. She serves as a data manager for the organization, and as a global liaison, helping to advise developing national phenology networks around the world, and working towards global integration of phenology data. Ellen lives in Kittery, Maine.

      introduction: >
        Emma Oschrin received her Ph.D. in Evolution, Ecology, and Behavior from Indiana University where she studied plant community ecology. She has also worked in the conservation non-profit sector, at the Mono Lake Committee in eastern California, where she gained an appreciation for interpretive science education. She now works at the Chicago Botanic Garden as the Budburst Director, leading a community science project, Budburst, that is focused on plant phenology and plant-pollinator interactions. Emma helps people engage with the nature in their communities and works to turn community scientists’ contribution to research into meaningful conservation action. Throughout her educational and work experience, she developed a passion for effective science communication and believes that connecting to the plants all around us can serve as a gateway to broader environmental activism. Emma lives in Chicago, the greatest city in America.
